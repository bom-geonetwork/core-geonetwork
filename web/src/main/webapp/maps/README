GeoNetwork uses whatever map context is in mapviewer.wmc as the background to the spatial search
map in the advanced options of the html5ui interface. 

To change this just copy the required wmc file
to mapview.wmc. At the moment, mapviewer_demis.wmc has been copied into mapviewer.wmc. 

Descriptions:

mapviewer_demis.wmc - uses Netherlands wms server demis to deliver continents and countries.
mapviewer_geoserverlocalhost.wmc - uses a GeoServer on localhost:8080 to deliver continents and countries.
wdev.bom.gov.au.wmc - uses a GeoServer on wdev/www4.bom.gov.au to deliver continents and countries.
